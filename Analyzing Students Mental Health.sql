/*
In the Analyzing Students' Mental Health in SQL project, we use  PostgreSQL skills to analyze the student data from a Japanese international university and spot one of the most influencing factors impacting the mental health of international students.

In this Project we focus on a specific contributing factorâ€”the length of stay and how it impacts the average diagnostic scores of international students.
